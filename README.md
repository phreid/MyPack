# MyPack

## Project Proposal

My project will be an application for hikers and backpackers. It will allow users to list the
items in their packs and keep track of the weight and cost of their gear. Users can keep track of
more than one pack, to account for different seasons or types of trips.

In each pack, users will be able to group their gear into custom categories, for example:
- Shelter
- Cooking equipment
- First aid
- Clothes
- Etc.

Each item of gear will have a name, description, cost, and weight. Further, users can mark an item
as **worn** or **consumable**. A **worn** item is an item the user wears on their person or otherwise carries
outside their pack such as clothing, a watch, or hiking poles. A **consumable** item is something that a user 
will consume over the course of a trip such as food, water, or fuel. This is relevant because backpackers
separate the weight of their pack into **total weight** and **base weight** (total weight minus 
the weight of worn and consumable items), with base weight considered more relevant.
